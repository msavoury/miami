# Miami
My guide to Miami and the surrounding South Florida areas.

# Food
There is no shortage of places to eat and cuisines to try, but most definitely try the Cuban food. In particular you want to try cuban coffee as well as some pastelitos. More details in the Cuban section below.
## [Hometown BBQ](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-miami-2?osq=hometown+bbq)
The best authentic BBQ spot in Miami hands down. 
## [Lung Yhai Tapas](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lung-yai-thai-tapas-miami)
Best Thai food in Miami. The rub is that it has some of the worst service in the world. But people keep coming back because it's so good. You have to order everything at once, and there are no substitutions.
## [Yardbird](https://www.yelp.com/biz/yardbird-table-and-bar-miami-beach)
Classic southern fried chicken spot on the beach.
## [KonChau](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kon-chau-restaurant-miami)
My favorite place for dimsum.
## [Ichimi](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichimi-gables-coral-gables-2)
My favorite place for ramen
## [Love and Gyros](https://www.yelp.com/biz/love-n-gyros-miami-3?osq=love+and+gyros)
A bit of a hole in the wall but the gyros here are some of the best. Try out the Sexy Zesty Pork and fries.
## [Pho 79](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-79-miami?osq=Pho+79)
There is more than one location, and they're all good. I tend to get to chicken Pho.
## [Joe's Stone Crab](https://joesstonecrab.com/)
## [Smith & Wollensky](https://www.smithandwollensky.com/our-restaurants/miami-beach/)

## Cuban
Cuban food gets its own section because it's one of the most 'Miami' things to eat.
