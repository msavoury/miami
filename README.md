# Miami
My guide to Miami and the surrounding South Florida areas.

# Transportation
This is listed first for those of you that come from cities with really good public transport and/or walkable cities. Miami is not one of those cities. In order to get around, expect to take an uber or rent a car. Cabs are rare and only circulate in certain areas. Plan accordingly.

# Food
There is no shortage of places to eat and cuisines to try, but most definitely try the Cuban food. In particular, you want to try cuban coffee as well as some pastelitos. More details in the Cuban section below.
## [Hometown BBQ](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-miami-2?osq=hometown+bbq)
The best authentic BBQ spot in Miami hands down. I'm a big fan of the Oaxcan chicken but just about everything here is good. Not in the best neighborhood, so don't plan to walk around here at night.
## [Lung Yhai Tapas](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lung-yai-thai-tapas-miami)
Best Thai food in Miami. The rub is that it has some of the worst service in the world. But people keep coming back because it's so good. You have to order everything at once, and there are no substitutions.
## [Yardbird](https://www.yelp.com/biz/yardbird-table-and-bar-miami-beach)
Classic southern fried chicken spot on the beach. The drinks here are also really good.
## [KonChau](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kon-chau-restaurant-miami)
My favorite place for dimsum.
## [Ichimi](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichimi-gables-coral-gables-2)
My favorite place for ramen, though there are a few other spots that also have decent ramen. My favorites are the tonkatsu and the beef ramen.
## [Love and Gyros](https://www.yelp.com/biz/love-n-gyros-miami-3?osq=love+and+gyros)
A bit of a hole in the wall but the gyros here are some of the best. Try out the Sexy Zesty Pork and fries.
## [Pho 79](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-79-miami?osq=Pho+79)
There is more than one location, and they're all good. I tend to get to chicken Pho.
## [Joe's Stone Crab](https://joesstonecrab.com/)
This is a classic Miami spot but keep in mind that Stone Crabs are only in season from mid October to May
## [Smith & Wollensky](https://www.smithandwollensky.com/our-restaurants/miami-beach/)
Steakhouse with views of the water on Miami Beach. A bit pricey but the food is great. 
## Cuban
Cuban food gets its own section because it's one of the most 'Miami' things to eat. Any of the following below work and they all have several locations. My favorite of the bunch is probably Sergio's. Classic dishes include
- Cuban sandwich
- Media Noche sandwich
- Lechon asado

# Nightlife
Not much of a nightlife person but here are some recommendations:
## [Sugar](https://www.easthotels.com/en/miami/restaurants-and-bars/sugar/)
Rooftop bar with great city views and decent drinks
## [Bodega](https://www.bodegataqueria.com/)
Taco bar with a speakeasy 'hidden' room that gets super packed late. Good for dancing
## [Hard Rock Hotel](https://www.seminolehardrockhollywood.com/)
If you're into casinos, this is the place to be

# Things to do
## [Key Biscayne](https://www.visitflorida.com/places-to-go/southeast/key-biscayne/)
Easiest Key to get to with plenty of activities
## [Key West](https://keywest.com/)
Most difficult Key to get to. Tons of traffic and there is one way in, one way out. Don't plan on going to key west unless you're in town for at least 2 weekends, other wise you'll likely spend too much time travelling to and from
## [Shark Valley](https://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/svdirections.htm)
Not a ton to do here but if you like biking and getting to see alligators up close and personal, this is it.

# Neighborhoods
## Miami Beach
This is "the" place to first time visitors. Like most tourist areas, there are a ton of tourist traps to be found. There are also a ton of people waiting to scam you. Stay vigilant and avoid helping strangers. The part of the beach south of 5th is more calm, and have some nice restaurants. North of this is where things can get wild during popular times such as Memorial Day weekend and Spring break. 
- Versace Mansion
- Boardwalk
## Wynwood
Gentrifying neighborhood that is now well-known for its artsy vibe with large street art murals. This place gets super packed at night and on weekends. Tons of places to eat, drink and be merry. The surrounding areas can be a bit sketch
- Wynwood walls
- Breweries
- Smorgasborg
## Coral Gables
More of a family friendly neighborhood with local shops and restaurants. One of the fancier (read expensive) parts of town.

## Design District
## Downtown/Brickell
## Calle Ocho
